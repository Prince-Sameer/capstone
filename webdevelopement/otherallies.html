                    The Ryugu Kingdom is the country that King Neptune rules over. It includes all of Fish-Man Island as well as the surrounding areas.
                    The majority of the buildings of the Ryugu Kingdom are designed like seashells. They are built on coral reefs. Some buildings are floating in the air with bubbles encasing them. Also, throughout the kingdom are water streams that arc through the air, allowing citizens to swim within them for transport, and with Bubbly Coral as an inner tube, people can float in air as well.
